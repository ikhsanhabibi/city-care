# city-care

This thesis aims to create an Android, multi-language application based
on the principle of developing a system in software engineering. It begins by
defining requirements from the concepts. This is illustrated by several diagrams
such as use case and sequence diagram. Production of paper prototyping and
digital prototyping followed. Before the implementation of the Android applica-
tion, the usability testing was conducted in order to improve the design. The
system was implemented using Java as a programming language. In the end, the
mobile application was evaluated on several Android devices. The aim of the
service is to enable the government or responsible party to maintain the city's
infrastructure aided by immediate digital complaints submitted by citizens. The
more convenient process of reporting infrastructure damage or destruction in the
city will encourage wider public reporting.
